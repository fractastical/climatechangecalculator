It does so by the following method:

1/ Separating out hard observable data of a historical nature 
2/ Doing all of the calculation and projections on the hardest data possible 

# CALCULATIONS

The goal is to build something that can calculate the likelihood of a certain outcome by a certain date based on the current conditions.

# DATA

Initial data sources chosen:

Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) variations computed at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center 
The Berkeley Earth Land/Ocean Temperature Record
